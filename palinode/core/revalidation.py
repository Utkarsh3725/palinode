"""Revision-aware support checks — is what this record rests on still standing?

``backed_by`` propagation (:mod:`palinode.consolidation.propagate`) flags the
*direct* dependents of a source when a retirement fires on it, and the flag
clears when the dependent is re-saved. That leaves three gaps this module
closes, all of them read-time and none of them a rewrite of anybody's prose:

**Second-hop conclusions.** Propagation walks one hop. A record resting on a
record resting on a retired source carried no qualification at all until some
later maintenance pass reached it. :func:`check_support` walks the backing
graph to :data:`DEFAULT_MAX_HOPS` hops (budgeted, cycle-safe) and reports the
second-hop root by name, with the hop it was found at.

**Withdrawn support is not a disproven conclusion.** A source that was
archived, superseded, expired, retired by location — or retracted with nothing
named as falsifying it — took its support with it: the dependent is
*uncertain* (:data:`SUPPORT_WITHDRAWN`). Only a source that names its evidence
(``falsified_by``, ADR-020's evidence-gated RETRACT) says the stronger thing
about the dependent (:data:`SUPPORT_DISPROVEN`) — and still not that the
opposite claim is true. Neither reason ever elects a value: a retraction
without a replacement yields uncertainty, exactly as a withdrawn *replacement*
does in :mod:`palinode.core.resolution` (``replacement_withdrawn``).

**A re-save is not a re-verification.** The convention that re-saving a
dependent clears its ``stale_backing`` flag reads a formatting-only edit as
"I checked this against its sources". Explicit evidence replaces the
convention: a record may carry ``revalidated:`` entries naming the source and
the exact revision checked, and a backing counts as revalidated only when the
recorded revision equals the source's **current** whole-file SHA-256 (the
delivery receipt's ``file_sha256`` revision basis). Re-saving the dependent changes the
dependent's bytes and certifies nothing about the source.

Frontmatter this module reads
-----------------------------

``backed_by: [<ref>, …]``
    Unchanged — the declared support. Read through
    :func:`palinode.core.typed_links.parse_link_refs`.
``backing_policy: all-of | any-of``
    Optional, and the only thing that lets a checker draw a conclusion from
    more than one source. ``all-of``: the record stands only while *every*
    named source stands. ``any-of``: it stands while *at least one* does. A
    list with no declared policy is :data:`POLICY_ADVISORY` — findings are
    reported per source and nothing is concluded automatically, which is what
    every legacy ``backed_by`` list means.
``revalidated: [{ref, revision, at}, …]``
    Optional revalidation receipts. ``revision`` is the source's whole-file
    SHA-256 at the moment it was checked; ``at`` is a UTC ISO-8601 stamp.
    One entry per source ref: re-recording the same ``(ref, revision)`` is a
    no-op, and a new revision replaces the entry (git holds the history).
``stale_backing: [{ref, op, at, …}, …]``
    Unchanged — what the retirement path persisted. Read here only to decide
    what a revalidation receipt may clear.

What this module never does
---------------------------

It never decides truth, never rewrites a body, and never derives a replacement
value: a dependent whose source was retired is qualified, not re-worded, and
the only replacement that may ever be followed is an explicit ``superseded_by``
chain, which is :mod:`palinode.core.resolution`'s job and not this module's.
:func:`check_support` is pure — frontmatter, an injected clock and an injected
reader in, a frozen :class:`SupportCheck` out — so the same store state and the
same ``now`` produce the same answer on every surface.

Caching
-------

:class:`SupportCache` is **per request** and nothing here caches across one.
Its reuse test is the delivery-receipt contract
(:ref:`the five conditions <reuse-contract>`) applied to a support check
rather than to a bundle: a warm entry is served only when the caller scope,
the policy version, every input ``(ref, revision)`` pair and the temporal
window bracketing the clock all still hold. Two of those cannot be seen in the
files at all — **an unchanged file is not evidence of an unchanged answer**: a
source with ``expires_at`` at noon is current at 11:59 and expired at 12:01
with nothing written in between, and a caller whose scope changed must not be
served the previous caller's evidence. Any cross-request reuse built later
must re-check caller access and applicable time *at delivery*, not only at the
key, for exactly that reason.

Persistent work
---------------

Read-time findings qualify a delivery; they do not touch disk. Where a finding
should become durable state, it goes through the paths that already exist:
:func:`enqueue_revalidation` writes the write-time marker
(:func:`palinode.consolidation.write_time._write_marker`) with a ``revalidate``
item, and :func:`apply_revalidation` — run by the same sweep/worker that drains
every other marker — re-checks against live disk, appends one ``stale_backing``
entry per new finding, removes entries a matching-revision receipt has
cleared, re-indexes and commits through ``git_tools``. Markdown and git
reconstruct the state; a marker that fails is renamed ``.failed.json`` for an
operator, as every other marker is.
